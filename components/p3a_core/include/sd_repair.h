 * @file sd_repair.h
 * @brief Self-healing for FAT32 damage inflicted by the SD card itself.
 *
 * Background (requests/01-sd-card-intermittent-failure): some microSD cards,
 * typically after a power cut, store 16 KB pages at the wrong logical
 * address. FatFS then sees foreign data inside a directory cluster or inside
 * the first FAT copy. Two symptoms follow:
 *
 *  - A directory whose leading entries were overwritten: FatFS's lookup
 *    (dir_find) stops at the first 0x00 entry it meets in the foreign data,
 *    while allocation (dir_alloc) skips past it, so every file created there
 *    is a phantom: fopen() succeeds, stat()/rename() of the same name fail
 *    with ENOENT, and the SD-failure latch trips after three of them. The
 *    files that used to be listed in that directory are unreachable.
 *  - A FAT1 sector overwritten with junk while FAT2 still holds the mirror.
 *    FatFS reads only FAT1, so chains through that sector read garbage and
 *    the clusters it covers are lost to allocation.
 *
 * This module repairs both without a PC and without formatting:
 *
 *  - sd_repair_heal_for_write(): probes the directory a write is failing in
 *    (create a marker, stat it). A directory that hides what was just created
 *    is quarantined (moved to {root}/lost/) and recreated empty. Caches
 *    (vault, giphy, klipy, museum, channel) refill themselves; user content
 *    that lived there was already unreachable and stays available in lost/
 *    for a PC to inspect. Called from the write choke points (fs_atomic,
 *    sd_path_ensure_parent_dirs) on ENOENT, never speculatively.
 *  - sd_repair_fat_mirror(): at boot, right after mount and before anything
 *    touches the FAT, compares FAT1 with FAT2 sector by sector and restores
 *    a sector whose copy is implausible (values outside the volume) or
 *    suspicious (a plausible-looking fragment that belongs elsewhere in the
 *    FAT) from the other copy. Sectors where both copies look sane but
 *    differ are left alone (FatFS resyncs them on its next write).
 *
 * Every repair is counted (per boot and persisted in NVS) and surfaced in
 * /status and the web UI: a card that needs repairing is a card that is
 * losing data, and the user should know.
